# -Analysing_the_effect_of_different_network_architectures_on_classification_accuracy_Mushroom_dataset
While I have previously investigated categorization using machine learning algorithms, I have to investigate neural networks. results on the Mushroom dataset classification accuracy I am really inspired to learn and analyze the influence of several network designs, notably MLP, RNN, CNN.
